# Homework 1 Request/Response

## Usage

run `pip3 install pytest ` for test_app.py

run `pip3 install flask` for app.py

run `python3 app.py`

## Components of program
### Hello, World
A program that imports a flask library and creates a route that returns a greeting to the user.

### Your User's Favorite Animal
Takes in a variable called user_animal in the url and return a string on the home page

### User's favorite Dessert
Takes in a variable called user_dessert in the url and return a string on the home page with the users favorite dessert.

### Mad Libs
Url takes in an adjective and noun and returns a mad lib string.

### Multiply Two Numbers
Url takes in two numbers. The function validates that both numbers are in fact numbers and will return a string with both numbers multiplied. If the numbers are not in fact numbers, it returns an error message.

### Say N times
Url takes a word and a number variable. Function verifies that the word is a string and that the number is an Integer. If both are true then it returns a string with the word multipled N times and if neither or one of them is not true, it returns an error message.

### Dice Game
Function calculates a random number and returns a string based on the number to imitate you rolling a dice. The number 6 wins and all other numbers lose. 

## Purpose of this project
The purpose of this project is to practice the request/response cycle by create routes using the flask server. Being comfortable with creating flask servers, routes and interacting with the url is important in understanding web architecture.
